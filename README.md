# Chess-clone
In this I prepared Chess clone app with the help backend develoment which includes following 
1.) Node.js as javascript run time environment to add modules through NPM and peform server setup at backend.

2). Express.js-Express is a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features for web and mobile applications. It is an open source framework developed and maintained by the Node.js foundation. We used express to perform routing between server and client.

3).Socket.io -It is used to establish connection between server and client with routing along with express.js.It connects both users with server and allow them to play together.

4) Chess.js -It is platform which contains all the set of valid rules of chess moves and various mehtods such as board,turn etc. in it.

I prepared chess board at my own in frontend of this project with the help of javascript,ejs,Tailwind Css.
